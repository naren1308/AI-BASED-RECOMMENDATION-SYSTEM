This Java program implements a User-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System using Apache Mahout. The system analyzes user-item interactions from a dataset and suggests items that a user might like based on the preferences of similar users. It follows a structured approach by loading a dataset, computing user similarities, identifying user neighborhoods, generating recommendations, and evaluating the recommendation quality. Tools and Libraries Used Apache Mahout - A scalable machine learning library used for building recommendation systems Java - The programming language used to implement the recommendation engine FileDataModel - A Mahout class that loads user-item rating data from a CSV file PearsonCorrelationSimilarity - A similarity metric used to measure the correlation between users NearestNUserNeighborhood - A method that finds the nearest neighbors of a user based on similarity scores GenericUserBasedRecommender - The core recommender system that generates user-based recommendations RecommenderEvaluator - A Mahout class used to evaluate the accuracy of the recommendation model List and RecommendedItem - Java collections used to store and display recommended items Exception Handling - A mechanism used to catch and handle errors such as missing data files or incorrect data formats
